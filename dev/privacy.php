                                                            In order to better provide you with our numerous services, we collect two types of information about our users: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using isUD.com.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                            Personally Identifiable Information(“PII”): This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. When you engage in certain activities on isUD.com, such as registering, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. We may ask, however, that you provide us personal information, such as your first and last name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and/or other PII. We may also collect information from you at other points on isUD.com that state that such information is being collected. However, this policy is subject to change without notice and we encourage you to periodically check our Policy statement.

We may gather certain general information about you based upon where and how you visit isUD.com in several ways. This information may be compiled and analyzed on both an individual and an aggregated basis. This information may include the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) that you just came from when you visited isUD.com, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and/or your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web (“Web”). An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (“TCP/IP”) network, such as the Web. Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web or allowing Web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet.

We may use PII to deliver information to you and to contact you regarding administrative notices. We may also use PII to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, and enforce our agreements with you. We will also use Non-PII to enhance the smooth operation of isUD.com, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, statistically analyze isUD.com’s use, improve our service offerings, and customize isUD.com’s Content, layout, and services. We DO NOT share your Non-PII with anyone else.

We will attempt to provide this notice by email, if you have given us an email address, or by postal mail if you have entered a postal address. We will independently object to overly broad requests for access to information about users of isUD.com. If you do not challenge the disclosure request, we may be legally required to turn over your information to law enforcement agencies or a court of competent jurisdiction.

                                                            At isUD.com, you can be assured that your PII is secure, consistent with current industry standards. The importance of security for all PII associated with our users is of utmost concern to us. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we may store your personal information on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number or password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) 256-bit encryption protocol, which is the industry standard and prevents unauthorized parties from viewing such information when it is transmitted.
                                                        </p>

                                                            In order to most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions are directly handled by established third-party banking and processing agents who receive the information needed to verify and authorize your credit card or other payment information. The IDeA Center does not currently receive any of your credit card information, however, this policy is subject to change.
                                                        </p>

                                                            Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we conscientiously strive to protect your PII, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet that are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through the The IDeA Center Site cannot be guaranteed; and (c) it is possible that any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with while in transit by a third party.
